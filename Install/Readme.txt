DFRefactor - The Automated Refactoring Tool for DataFlex

This will install the full DFRefactor workspace, including source code. It does NOT create any Windows menu items or make changes to the registry - it just copies all the source files to the directory of choice.

DFRefactor is a tool written in DataFlex that helps with refactoring of old DataFlex code. It consists of a series of functions to help in the refactoring process. Each refactoring function is represented by a checkbox. 

There are two types of refactoring functions; Refactoring Functions and Reporting Functions. The first category makes actual changes to the selected source code, while the second category only creates a report what may need to handled later manually.

You need a DataFlex Studio 18.2 or later to compile the source file DFRefactor.src to an executable.
