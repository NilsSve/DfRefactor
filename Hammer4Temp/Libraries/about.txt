If you retrieved this workspace via subversion then this folder contains Libraries that are added as externals.

As a result the application workspace uses the most current version of the library workspace on checkout, unless that library is pinned against a certain version.
Unless you are the author or maintainer of a library then you should _NOT_ commit any changes to that library. 

If you got the whole application workspace as a single zip file then it will just contain the library as it was at the time of the zip file.
It will not be automically updated if fixes or patches arrive.
