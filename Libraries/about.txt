
It is highly recommended to download and install the GitHub Desktop app, as it will significantly simplify your work. You can download it via this link: https://desktop.github.com/download/.

Once installed, click the "<> Code" button at this GitHub page and select "Open with GitHub Desktop." This will install the complete repository in your chosen download location.

Note: Do not select "Download ZIP," as GitHub will not include the libraries used by the workspace, and you would need to download them manually, which can be cumbersome!
If you retrieved this workspace via git then this folder contains Libraries that are added as submodules.

As a result, the application workspace uses the most current version of the library workspace on checkout.
