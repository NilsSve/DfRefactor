If you retrieved this workspace via git then this folder contains Libraries that are added as submodules.

As a result, the application workspace uses the most current version of the library workspace on checkout.

If you got the whole application workspace as a single zip file then it will just contain the libraries as they were at the time of the zip file.
It will not be automatically updated if fixes or patches arrive.
