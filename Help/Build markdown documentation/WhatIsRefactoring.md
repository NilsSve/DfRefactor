# DFRefactor - Refactoring Code for DataFlex

## Code refactoring: What is it?

Code refactoring is a disciplined technique for used to restructure existing computer code. It involves altering the internal structure of code without changing external behavior or functionality.&nbsp;

The goal is to make incremental changes that leave the code in a better state than when it was initially found. Ultimately, refactoring leads to cleaner, more maintainable code.

## DataFlex Refactoring: Bringing Legacy Code Up to Modern Standards

The DataFlex language has evolved over several decades, dating back to the 1980s. However, much of earlier DataFlex syntax is now considered depreciated or obsolete. Some of the outdated code may still be present in the help system, albeit marked as obsolete.

&nbsp;

For developers who haven't with DataFlex since the 1980s and forward, encountering old legacy code can be confusing. Educating new developers on legacy code that no longer makes sense can also be challenging.

&nbsp;

Even if old legacy code remains compatible it's essential to improve it trough refactoring. Refactoring makes the code more readable and easier to understand. Neglecting this process can prove costly for companies.**Therefore, updating legacy DataFlex code to modern standards is crucial.**

&nbsp;

***The DFRefactor tool** assists in this refactoring process. It provides a series of functions designed to improve DataFlex code. Developers can select the desired functions and initiate the refactoring process. RDC Tools International, the developer of DFRefactor, specializes in helping companies bring their software up to modern standards.*

***Remember: Refactoring doesn't change external behavior; it enhances code quality and readability. After all, readability is directly proportional to the number of bugs\!***

&nbsp;

## What is not code refactoring?

Changing an algorithm to something much faster is obviously ***not*** refactoring, because the external behavior is changed. We do ***not*** expect new behavior with refactoring.

## There are two general categories of benefits when it comes to refactoring

&nbsp;

**&#49;. Maintainability:**

* &nbsp;
  * **Easier bug Fixes**: Refactoring improves maintainability by making the source code easy to read. When code is clear and well-organized, it's simpler to identify and fix bugs. Developers can quickly grasp the intent behind each piece of code.
  * **Breaking Down Monolithic Routines**: Large, monolithic routines can be challenging to understand and maintain. Refactoring involves breaking them down into smaller, concise methods. These well-named, single-purpose methods enhance readability, and maintainability.
  * **Removing Misleading Comments**: Refactoring also includes removing misleading or outdated comments. Clear code eliminates confusion and reduces the risk of introducing errors.

&nbsp;

**&#50;. Extensibility:**

* &nbsp;
  * **Recognizable Design Patterns:** Refactored code often adheres to recognizable design patterns. These patterns make it easier to extend the application's capabilities. Developers can build upon existing structures, ensuring consistency and scalability.
  * **Increased Flexibility**: Refactoring introduces flexibility where non existed before. By improving the code's structure, developers can add new features or modify existing ones without major disruptions.

## Why automated refactoring?

* &nbsp;
  * **Reduced Tedium**: Manual refactoring can be tedious, especially when dealing with large codebases. Automated tools streamline the process, saving time and effort.
  * **Minimized Error Risk**: Automated refactoring routines undergo rigorous testing and validation. Using these proven routines minimizes the risk of compromising the external structure of your program.
  * **Optimal Balance**: While manual refactoring provides freedom, automated tools strike the balance by ensuring reliability and efficiency.
