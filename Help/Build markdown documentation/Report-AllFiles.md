# Refactoring Functions

**&nbsp;** ![Image](<lib/Report.png>) **REPORT - ALL FILES**

* # Report Unused Source Files - All Files

Report files that are never used. Writes a list of all unused source files to a log file and shows them in a "Unused Source Files" grid dialog.&nbsp;

It will **NOT** make any changes to the source, but from the dialog you can select which files (if any) should be moved to the backup area.

&nbsp;

The report will be added to the **Other Log files** dialog after a successful refactoring session. You find the **Other Log files** in the toolbar next to the **View Log file** toolbar button.
