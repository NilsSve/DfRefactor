# Refactoring Functions

# The tool can be run in two different modes: Workspace or File mode. If File mode has been selected from the toolbar, selected refactoring functions will be applied to a single file only.

# If Workspace mode is selected, the selected refactoring functions will be applied to all source code files that matches the File Filter drop-down list of file extensions, and for all folders selected from the Select Folders grid.

There are different types of Refactoring Functions:

&nbsp;

[**Standard - Line-by-line**](<Standard-Line-by-Line>)**:**

Changes the source code according to the description of selected function. The Refactoring Engine does so by calling the selected refactoring functions one after the other, one source line at a time, thus gradually transforming the source line.

[**Remove - Line-by-line**](<Remove-Line-by-Line>)**:**

Changes the code by focusing on removing unused features that are no longer needed.

[**Editor - One File**](<Editor-OneFile>)**:**

Changes the source code focusing on organizing the code and making it more readable.

[**Report - One File**](<Report-OneFile>)**:**

Only reports anomalies in the source code and writes out a list of affected source files. Makes no code changes.

[**Report - All Files**](<Report-AllFiles>)**:**

Does not make changes to the source code. All selected files are passed to the refactoring function as a string array.

[**Other - One File**](<Other-OneFile>)**:**

Expects a full source file as a string array.

[**Other - All Files**](<Other-AllFiles>)**:**

Expects a string array with all file names including full path.
